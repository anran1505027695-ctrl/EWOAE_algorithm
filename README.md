# EWOAE Algorithm

This repository provides the core algorithm implementation of the
Elevation and  Water Occurrence–based (EWOAE) algorithm proposed in the paper.

The code is intended to illustrate the main algorithmic workflow and
decision logic, rather than to serve as a fully automated software package.

## Contents
- `EWOAE_algorithm.js`: Core algorithm file implementing the EWOAE Algorithm

## Notes
- The code demonstrates the key computational steps of the algorithm.
- Users may need to adapt the code to their own datasets and platforms.
- The implementation is provided for transparency and reproducibility
  of the proposed method.
